# Mini Grocery Store - React.js Cart & Filter Interface

## Overview

This project is a mini grocery store built using React.js (Vite), JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3. It allows users to browse a catalog of grocery products, filter products by category, add/remove items from a shopping cart, and persists cart data across browser sessions using `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Product Catalog**:  
  Displays 12 grocery products, each with name, price, category, and an image.

- **Category Filter**:  
  Dynamically generates category buttons from the product dataset.  
  Users can filter products by category or view all products.

- **Shopping Cart**:  
  Users can add products to the cart.  
  Cart shows selected products, quantity, and cumulative total price.  
  Users can remove items from the cart.  
  Cart data persists using `localStorage` â€” cart contents remain after page reload.

- **Responsive Layout**:  
  Clean and responsive UI built with only HTML5 and CSS3 (no UI frameworks or libraries).
